> Housing dataset is provided and one is supposed to find most important features that impact sale price (target variable).


## Conclusions
- I experimented with various values of polynomial degrees, alpha values and combination of Linear regression models and found out that Lasso Regression (Regularization technique) with MinMaxScaler seems to be the best suit in above case(with said degrees and alpha value) as it is giving training R-Squared value of 87 and test R-Squared value of 86.
